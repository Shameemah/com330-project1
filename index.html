          I started out college as an Architecture major. In that time, I discovered that
          although I have always been passionate about human centered design, I am more
          interested in creating digital experiences and products, rather than physical
          structures. After a year, I switched majors to Information Technology and
          Management. For the last few years, I have dabbled and gained knowledge in
          several different aspects of technology. But I have learned over time that my
          value as a professional can be summed up into 5 points:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I am a polyglot technologist: I speak nerdy, product manager, UI/UX
            designer, editor, software developer and analyst.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am part designer, part developer. Creative and analytical.
            Right-brained and left-brained.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the words of Rudyard Kipling, I believe that "the strength of the
            Pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the Pack." I apply
            this philosophy in working with teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            My introversion is my super power. I observe closely, listen
            attentively,process thoroughly and innovate quietly.
          </li>
          <li>
            I go unafraid.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In this class, I hope to learn to write and design for the web in a
          way that is convincing and captivating, and to build upon my already
          existing online presence in a way that is more representative of my
          brand.
