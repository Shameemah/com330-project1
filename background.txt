I started out college as an Architecture major. In that time, I discovered that
although I have always been passionate about human centered design, I am more
interested in creating digital experiences and products, rather than physical
structures. After a year, I switched majors to Information Technology and
Management. For the last few years, I have dabbled and gained knowledge in
several different aspects of technology. But I have learned over time that my
value as a professional can be summed up into 5 points:

1. I am a polyglot technologist: I speak nerdy, product manager, UI/UX designer,
editor, software developer and analyst.
2. I am part designer, part developer. Creative and analytical. Right-brained
and left-brained.
3. In the words of Rudyard Kipling, I believe that "the strength of the Pack is
the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the Pack." I apply this philosophy in
working with teams.
4. My introversion is my super power. I observe closely, listen attentively,
process thoroughly and innovate quietly.
5. I go unafraid.

In this class, I hope to learn to write and design for the web in a way that is
convincing and captivating, and to build upon my already existing online presence
in a way that is more representative of my brand.
